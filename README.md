# Variable Font Preview 3

The famous plugin now available for Glyphs 3 with piles of improvements and new features.

⚠️ Do not download directly from here. Please install via GlyphsApp’s Plugin Manager ⚠️


## Highlights

- You can now download it directly from the Plugin Manager right inside of GlyphsApp.
- No axes limit.
- Magnifier: Click into the preview to show/close. Hold `cmd` key while moving the mouse to reposition.
- Measurement of interpolation: Select 2 nodes to measure horizontal and vertical distance as well as the angle.
- Standalone window: Choose between the preview inside of the Edit Tab or as a window. YOu can put that on another screen.
- More compact sliders: cleaner UI, less finger fatigue.
- Choose to round values or use floats.
- Percentage bars for masters involvements.
- Updates will load automatically. You will never have to manually install any updates anymore.
